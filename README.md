# ALPHA: TDS – Transport Duration Switzeraland

**TDS** is a command-line tool to compare travel durations between two locations in Switzerland, using both public transport and car routes. It leverages live data from [transport.opendata.ch](https://transport.opendata.ch) and [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org).

## Why use TDS?

When you need to make fast, informed decisions about how to get from point A to point B, most apps force you to sift through results and compare transport modes manually.  
**TDS gives you immediate, insight in your terminal**: the fastest public transport route (with transfers and breakdown) side-by-side with the car duration.

## Features

- Compares public transport vs car travel durations
- Displays detailed rail/bus/walk segments including times and platforms
- Supports natural language locations and full addresses
- Uses real-time connection data and geocoding
